# K2S Downloader

Python tools for downloading Keep2Share files with parallel range requests. The project now offers both a command line workflow and a PySide6 desktop UI.

## Environment
- Tested on Python 3.10+ on Windows
- Designed to work on macOS and Linux (requires ffmpeg for video integrity checks)

## Prerequisites
1. Install uv (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
2. Ensure ffmpeg is available in your PATH if you want automatic media validation

## Setup
`ash
uv sync
`
This creates an isolated environment and installs the dependencies declared in pyproject.toml.

## Command Line Usage
`ash
uv run k2s-downloader <k2s_url> [--filename NAME] [--threads N] [--split-size SIZE] [--no-ffmpeg-check]
`
Example:
`ash
uv run k2s-downloader https://k2s.cc/file/abc123 --threads 32 --split-size 32M
`

## GUI Usage
`ash
uv run k2s-downloader-gui
`
Provide the K2S link inside the application, optionally override the output filename, adjust the thread count and split size, then start the download. Captcha prompts appear inline.

## Legacy Entry Points
For compatibility, running python main.py ... still forwards to the CLI entry point.
